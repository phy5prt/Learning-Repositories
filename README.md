PP Repo is the more graphical version though still has the sun removed and grass
and various other aspects

PPLV1 is the lighter version with quarter the map size

Scripts are in assets then scripts folders

if using the files then you will ideally want to use unity 2017.4.9

In the PPLV1 folder at the bottom is the testpedalpirates.exe

this version at time of writing is the only built version I've been working with

The arduino file in pplv1 has the script for the arduino in it
the arduino is used as a controller rather than testing by pedaling eight bikes

I made a game to draw crowds at events for a CIC. It utilised their bespoke power-generating bikes as the game's inputs. To develop I used agile methodologies: user stories, trello, sprints, scrums and spikes. In other projects I have implemented these approaches along with pair programming.

This is my main portfolio website. It is accessible at https://phy5prt.github.io/BootstrapPortfolioWebsite/

This Website features: Simple animations for a little movement and colour. It is mobile friendly and easy to use. It has a contact page with a contact form using dataFire SaaS as a backend service utilising gmail api. It is just a clean, simple and professional site.

My creative site is accessible at https://lit-escarpment-48431.herokuapp.com/ it has the same information though is more creatively displayed with backend database, filtering and animations. This site is not currently suitable for smaller devices.
